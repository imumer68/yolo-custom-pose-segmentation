This repository offers two kinds of files that make computers smart at understanding images. 

  1) First, there's a special model that we trained ourselves by showing it small number of eagles pictures. Now, it can look at new eagle pictures and tell us what they're showing with great accuracy. 

  2) Then, there are files that use a powerful pre-made model called 'yolov8n.pt'. These files are like supercharged tools that can not only find objects in pictures but also figure out how they're positioned and even separate them from the background. It's like giving the computer eyes that can see and understand the world around it in incredible detail.

These files are like windows into the magic of teaching computers to see like us, and they open up exciting possibilities for all sorts of amazing applications.
